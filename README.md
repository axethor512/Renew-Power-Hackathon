Introduction

- In this hackathon, ReNew Power shared minute-wise normalized data of wind speed, power and temperature data for multiple components of a wind turbine. 
- The company is looking to create a model to get an ideally functioning turbineâ€™s expected rotor bearing temperature.
- It will then use the model to check the deviation of the actual rotor bearing temperature of the faulty turbine from the expected temperature.![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.001.png)![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.003.png)


Data Description

- Dataset is divided into 15 features and one Target variable
- 15 features can be broadly classified into 4 factors:
  - Power factor:- Active Power, Reactive Power (both raw and converted), generator speed and Average Power for 10 minutes.
  - Temperature factor:- Ambient Temperature, Nacelle Temperature(both inside and outside) and wire winding temperature
  - Wind factor:- Wind speed, wind direction, wind speed Turbulence
  - Other:- Timestamp and Turbine Id
  - We have to predict Rotor bearing Temperature.

Feature Engineering

Hypothesis 1: *Wind Speed and Ambient Temperature are Time and season specific. Hence, there is a need to extract time and season features from timestamp variable*

New Features created: - Hour (Time specific), Month(Season specific) Hypothesis 2 :- *Rotor Bearing Temperature is dependent on power loss*

New Features created: - Active Power loss, Reactive Power loss and Apparent Power(Active+Reactive)![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.001.png)![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.003.png)

Exploratory Data Analysis-Univariate Analysis

- Most of the Features are right-skewed having high presence of outliers![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.007.png)![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.008.png)

Bivariate Analysis:- Correlation

- We can observe that variables  ![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.013.jpeg)are highly correlated. Specially  power factor variables are highly  correlated  ![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.007.png)![](Aspose.Words.39f3e8a0-66d5-466c-bc58-0ef9d6aec78d.008.png)
