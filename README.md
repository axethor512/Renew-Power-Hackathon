# Renew-Power-Hackathon
Renew Power Hackathon organised by Machine Hack

APPROACH:-

Hackathon

Approach Presented By: Akshay Thorat



Introduction

- In this hackathon, ReNew Power shared minute-wise normalized data of wind speed, power and temperature data for multiple components of a wind turbine. 
- The company is looking to create a model to get an ideally functioning turbineâ€™s expected rotor bearing temperature.
- It will then use the model to check the deviation of the actual rotor bearing temperature of the faulty turbine from the expected temperature.


Data Description

- Dataset is divided into 15 features and one Target variable
- 15 features can be broadly classified into 4 factors:
  - Power factor:- Active Power, Reactive Power (both raw and converted), generator speed and Average Power for 10 minutes.
  - Temperature factor:- Ambient Temperature, Nacelle Temperature(both inside and outside) and wire winding temperature
  - Wind factor:- Wind speed, wind direction, wind speed Turbulence
  - Other:- Timestamp and Turbine Id
  - We have to predict Rotor bearing Temperature.
